Reactor is a Service and Configuration management system designed for the modern world of ephemeral containers and software delivery.
<p>
Conventional configuration management systems are focused on servers, and pivot around static assets. They also struggle with the concepts of continuous software delivery, management of secrets, and Infrastructure as Code.
<p>
Reactor is designed around the concept of services, live configuration states delivered at run-time for ephemeral deployments in continuous delivery pipelines.
<p>
Reactor is not designed to be a software delivery system, nor is it designed to be a software build system. It is instead meant to fill in the gaps of the variety of existing systems, fixing many of the challenges faced as the industry evolves and improves.
<p>
It is designed with modern ABAC security concepts, and is meant to support secure run-time delivery of services, enhancing the solutions you already may have in place today to improve your options beyond what is possible with your current tools.
