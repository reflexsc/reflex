Reactor is a Service and Configuration management system designed for the modern world of ephemeral containers and software delivery.

Conventional configuration management systems are focused on servers, and pivot around static assets. They also struggle with the concepts of continuous software delivery, management of secrets, and Infrastructure as Code.

Reactor is designed around the concept of services, live configuration states delivered at run-time for ephemeral deployments in continuous delivery pipelines.

Reactor is not designed to be a software delivery system, nor is it designed to be a software build system. It is instead meant to fill in the gaps of the variety of existing systems, fixing many of the challenges faced as the industry evolves and improves.

It is designed with modern ABAC security concepts, and is meant to support secure run-time delivery of services, enhancing the solutions you already may have in place today to improve your options beyond what is possible with your current tools.
